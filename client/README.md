## Online Chat Application

### Hello
Thank you for checking out my application! I created this simple online chat app out of pure software engineering curiosity. The client side application is currently deployed here:

[Online Chat App (Client)](https://ellipsoul.github.io/online-chat-app/)

And the server is deployed here. As a server, there's nothing at the root directory, but here's the subdirectory that retrieves all messages using a GET request:

### Technologies

I learnt to use a whole spectrum of languages/frameworks throughout this project. They include:

- HTML
- CSS
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

And explored even more technologies that did not make the final product (this time):

- [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- [GCP Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)
- [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
